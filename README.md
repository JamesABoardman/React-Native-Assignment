# React-Native-Assignment
<code>
This repository has been created to store and and update the progress on my React-Native Assignment. 
This is a final year assignment created to mimic Twitter but in my case Chittr using an [openAPI](http://editor.swagger.io/).<code>

<code>These are where I created my Wireframes for designing the application: [Wireframes](https://github.com/JamesHullCS/React-Native-Assignment/tree/master/React%20Wireframes)<code>

<code>The React-Native Application files are located here: [Assignment Files](https://github.com/JamesHullCS/React-Native-Assignment/tree/master/Assignment)<code>



**Assignment Task Order**

- [ ] Design your application’s layout and structure
- [x] Create a new application using the reference guide for help
- [ ] Implement your application’s navigation structure using your wireframes
- [ ] Implement the GET /chits end point to ensure that you can successfully query the API and
present the results within your application
- [ ] Implement the POST /user end point so that new users can sign up for accounts
- [ ] Implement the login and logout end points
- [ ] Implement the remaining ‘User Management’ end points except for anything that requires
working with images
- [ ] Implement the remaining ‘Posting Chits’ end points except for anything that requires
working with images (at this stage, do not implement the geolocation tagging when creating
new Chits).
- [ ] Implement the ‘Follower management’ end points
- [ ] Implement all end points that require working with images
- [ ] Edit the POST /chits end point to include the option for a user to tag their current location.

**Extension tasks**

- [ ] Alter your application so that users can save local drafts of Chits before sending
them to the API. You will need to save these drafts to permanent storage within the mobile device
and have functionality to view, edit and delete these drafts (much in the same way that mail clients
work).
- [ ] Alter your solution to Extension task 1 by allowing users to schedule when a draft
Chit is posted.
