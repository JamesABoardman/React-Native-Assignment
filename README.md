# React-Native-Assignment
This repository has been created to store and and update the progress on my React-Native Assignment. 
This is a final year assignment created to mimic Twitter but in my case Chittr using an [openAPI](http://editor.swagger.io/).

These are where I created my Wireframes for designing the application: [Wireframes](https://github.com/JamesHullCS/React-Native-Assignment/tree/master/React%20Wireframes)
